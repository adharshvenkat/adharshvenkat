## About Me
I am a Robotics Software Engineer with experience in Robot Navigation, Perception, Robot Fleet Management. I've worked on building several end-to-end systems for Autonomous Mobile Robots using ROS/ROS2, Computer Vision and Point Cloud Library in C++ and Python. I'm an advocate for building scalable systems, and have worked with several DevOps tools such as Git, Docker, Jenkins & cloud infrastructure such as AWS. 

I'm extremely passionate about harnessing the power of machine learning & distributed computing to revolutionise industries in an ever-advancing world. Over the past several years, I've worked on multiple personal projects in ML/AI ranging from Computer Vision to NLP leveraging a plethora of toolkits & technologies including Scikit-Learn, Tensorflow, PyTorch, NLTK, and HuggingFace.
